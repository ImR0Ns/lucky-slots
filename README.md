# lucky-slot game

A sketch of a game of chance, with paytable, balance, bet, last win, jackpots and many others.

TARGET 1:
The next update will be for the jackpots to work, 
to be paid after you hit play and all the elements have been put in place, 
showing how they are linked to each other and how you were paid with the help of the paytable.

UPDATES:
The balance and the last win were made functional, 
The system was made to link to each spin if there are links you will be paid, 
The check was added in case you have too little balance to not be able to play.
Small bugs fixed!

TARGET 2:
Functional jackpots that increase depending on the bet and how much you play!
Showing how they are linked to each other and how you were paid with the help of the paytable. (COLOR)
Links in ^ because in v were made.
Probably interface change.
